# MapReduce-Hadoop-Hive
In this project, I will implement the "Bag of Little Bootstraps" for a large dataset using the array job capabilities of Gauss, develop a MapReduce algorithm and run it via Hadoop Streaming on Amazon Elastic MapReduce, and, finally, perform some basic data manipulation using Hive (again on Elastic MapReduce).
